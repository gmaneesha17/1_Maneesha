Title : AI-Powered Personal Expense Categorization & Summary Assistant

This project builds an AI-powered system to automatically categorize personal financial transactions with unstructured descriptions.
It uses Machine Learning and Generative AI to analyze spending patterns and handle ambiguous transactions.
The system generates clear, human-readable monthly expense summaries for better financial understanding.
A RAG-based assistant allows users to ask questions about their spending behavior.
The solution helps users make informed and smarter financial decisions.

Solution Approach :

The proposed solution uses a hybrid AI approach:

Rule-based logic for identifying common transaction patterns and merchants

Machine Learning for automated expense classification

Generative AI for handling ambiguous transactions and generating spending summaries

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user queries based on transaction data
