This project builds an AI-powered system to automatically categorize personal financial transactions with unstructured descriptions.
It uses Machine Learning and Generative AI to analyze spending patterns and handle ambiguous transactions.
The system generates clear, human-readable monthly expense summaries for better financial understanding.
A RAG-based assistant allows users to ask questions about their spending behavior.
The solution helps users make informed and smarter financial decisions.
